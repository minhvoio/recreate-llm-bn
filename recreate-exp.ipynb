    "PROMPT = r\"I would like to answer the information to make an inference on a Bayesian Network. It is necessary to detect the variables of interest and the evidence presented in a question. The evidence is binary (yes, no). Only include evidence which is present on the question. The variables of interest should not be in the evidence. No explanation, no prediction of probability, only give short answer in this format, with a semicolon seperate them like this: variables_of_interest: []; evidence: {}\""
